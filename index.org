* About Me

I'm a recently graduated Software Engineer who cares about code
cleanliness and doing things right the first time. I love to try out
new technologies -- just take a look through my projects.

I'm currently looking for a job, so shoot me an [[mailto:dbordak@gmail.com][email]] if you'd like to
chat!
