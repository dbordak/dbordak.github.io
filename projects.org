[[https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line][file:./media/abs.png]]

A new implementation of [[https://github.com/powerline/powerline][Powerline]] for Emacs. As compared to the
existing version, telephone-line features greater extensibility -- it
is possible to add your own modeline segments, reorder them, add more,
customize separators, and more!

Pictured is a very standard powerline theme, but there are many more
separators included.

[[https://github.com/dbordak/words][file:./media/words.png]]

An implementation of [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames][Codenames]] by Vlaada Chv√°til using Elixir+Phoenix
for the backend and Elm for the frontend. This was mostly a learning
project for the aforementioned technologies, but this is actually a
fully functioning game! There are a few issues (check github), but you
can play complete games.

** [[https://github.com/dbordak/shar.el][shar.el]]

An Emacs plugin that shares your current buffer via email or SMS.

Won 3rd place at the Spring 2015 HackRU!

** [[https://github.com/revan/BusOccupancy][BusOccupancy]]

[[https://github.com/revan/BusOccupancy][file:./media/bus_occupancy.png]]

Independent Study project. We observed the occupancy of a bus route
directly, then attempted to develop a reliable estimate by analyzing
the data with various heuristics. The initial data was gathered via
tcpdump, and the graphs were produced using Pandas+Numpy.

** [[https://github.com/revan/captcha4charity][captcha4charity]]

[[https://github.com/revan/captcha4charity][file:./media/captcha4charity.png]]

A crowdsourced captcha solver which raises money for charity. The
project wasn't quite finished, but it still made for a nice
presentation.

Won "Restored Faith In Humanity" at the Spring 2014 HackRU!

** [[https://github.com/dbordak/mailcraft][mailcraft]]

[[https://github.com/dbordak/mailcraft][file:./media/mailcraft.png]]

A maze generator for Minecraft using email threads to determine the shape.

Won "Best Use of the Context.IO API" at the Fall 2013 HackRU!
